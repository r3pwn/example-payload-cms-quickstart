# payload-cms-quickstart-sandbox
This project aims to be an easy way of setting up a Payload CMS project alongside a fresh MongoDB instance via docker-compose..

To start, run `docker-compose up` from the root-level of the project.

If everything built and started correctly, the Payload CMS Admin panel should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/admin`
